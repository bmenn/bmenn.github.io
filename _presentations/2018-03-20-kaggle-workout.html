  ## Intros
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:" class="center">
  ### What to expect
  * Overview of what Kaggle is
  * A biased opinion on it's usefulness
  * A personal story of a Kaggle competition

  Notes:
  Lessons learned included in story
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:" class="center">
  ### What's not happening
  * Tips and tricks on being a Kaggle master
  * Discussion on the best ML technique for X
  * Data scientist in 7 days

  Notes:
  Still far from Kaggle master

  Data science is not a fast learning curve, see Peter Norvig's learn to
  program in 10 years.
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:" class="center">
  ### Who am I?
  * Machine Learning Engineer at Embedded Intelligence
  * Previously data analyst/software engineer/data scientist at Philips Wellcentive
  * Healthcare data scientist at heart
  * But any interesting, impactful project will do
  * Project lead at Anidata

  Notes:
  Note the career transitions for those who are trying to make a transition

  ## What is Kaggle?

  * Data science competition hosting site <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  * Open datasets <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  * Public notebooks <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:" class="center">
  <script type="text/template">
  ### The Good
  * Lots of various competitions in different domains <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  * Learning focused community  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  * Re-visit old competitions (but no karma/rep points) <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  * Put in == Get out <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

  Notes:
  Domains: marketing, actuarial (insurance), images, healthcare, NLP

  Lots are shared (not quite everything but a lot, it is competitive)

  Karma/rep points are not that important

  What you put in is what you get out
  </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:" class="center">
  # $$$ Prize Monies $$$

  Notes:
  Prizes have been $10-20K for big competitions

  Average is $1-5k

  But this really isn't that important, not the community's focus

  ## The Bad
  * **NOT** a stable source of income
  * **NOT** a shortcut to a data science job
  * **NOT** a data science job simulator

  Notes:
  Kaggle ability is a good filter but not indicator, but personally do not
  filter interviewee this way.
  </script>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:" class="center">

  ### Things not simulated (aka the Ugly)
  * Business purpose
  * Ability to translate business need to training criteria
  * Selecting loss/cost functions
  * Evaluating model performance
  * Communicating ML details to non-technical coworkers/managers
  * Communicating with customers
  * Finding data and munging multiple sources
  * Writing production code
  * Writing tests for code
  * Deploying production models
  * Being a data engineer
  * Being a software engineer
  * And lots more

  Notes:
  Kaggle is a sanitized, G-rated, training-wheels included data science
  experience.

  Most management currently have no clue what to do with data (tailor to audience)

  Rarely is one metric/function sufficient to quantify a model

  Customers just want things to work

  Multi-discipline is common in small teams

  Ask audience data scientists to chime in

  ## Personal Case Study
  ### Tensorflow Speech recognition challenge
</section>

<section>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge"
      style="font-size:x-large">
    <p>We might be on the verge of too many screens. It seems like everyday,
    new versions of common objects are “re-invented” with built-in wifi and
    bright touchscreens. A promising antidote to our screen addiction are
    voice interfaces.</p>

    <p>But, for independent makers and entrepreneurs, it’s hard to build a
    simple speech detector using free, open data and code. Many voice
    recognition datasets require preprocessing before a neural network model
    can be built on them. To help with this, TensorFlow recently released
    the Speech Commands Datasets. It includes 65,000 one-second long
    utterances of 30 short words, by thousands of different people.</p>

    <p>In this competition, you're challenged to use the Speech Commands
    Dataset to build an algorithm that understands simple spoken commands.
    By improving the recognition accuracy of open-sourced voice interface
    tools, we can improve product effectiveness and their accessibility.</p>

  ### Goal's coming into the competition
  * Test speed of setting up a training pipeline <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
  * Learn how to track model tuning experiments <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
  * Learn how to do speech recognition <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
  * Distill neural networks <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
  * Transfer distilled net to a Raspberry Pi <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->

  Notes:
  Tried doing this in 2 weeks, bad idea. Lost sleep, etc.

  Explain which ones worked out and which ones didn't.

  ### Lessons learned
  * Pay attention to competition announcements
  * <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" --> Training pipelines are great
  *when they work* <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  * <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" --> Test your code
  **often** <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  * <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" --> Practice bring **hyper-focus** to learning material

  Notes:
  CI/CD great for testing code, Unit tests good place to start (after
  learning how to writ code).

  Found several good papers try to troubleshoot.
