  ## Intros
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:" class="center">
  ### What to expect
  * Overview of what Kaggle is
  * A biased opinion on it's usefulness
  * A personal story of a Kaggle competition

  Notes:
  Lessons learned included in story
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:" class="center">
  ### What's not happening
  * Tips and tricks on being a Kaggle master
  * Discussion on the best ML technique for X
  * Data scientist in 7 days

  Notes:
  Still far from Kaggle master

  Data science is not a fast learning curve
</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:" class="center">
  ### Who am I?
  * Machine Learning Engineer at Embedded Intelligence
  * Previously data analyst/software engineer/data scientist at Philips Wellcentive
  * Healthcare data scientist at heart
  * Project lead at Anidata

  Notes:
  Note the career transitions for those who are trying to make a transition

  ## Personal Case Study
  ### Tensorflow Speech recognition challenge
</section>

<section>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge"
      style="font-size:x-large">
    <p>We might be on the verge of too many screens. It seems like everyday,
    new versions of common objects are “re-invented” with built-in wifi and
    bright touchscreens. A promising antidote to our screen addiction are
    voice interfaces.</p>

    <p>But, for independent makers and entrepreneurs, it’s hard to build a
    simple speech detector using free, open data and code. Many voice
    recognition datasets require preprocessing before a neural network model
    can be built on them. To help with this, TensorFlow recently released
    the Speech Commands Datasets. It includes 65,000 one-second long
    utterances of 30 short words, by thousands of different people.</p>

    <p>In this competition, you're challenged to use the Speech Commands
    Dataset to build an algorithm that understands simple spoken commands.
    By improving the recognition accuracy of open-sourced voice interface
    tools, we can improve product effectiveness and their accessibility.</p>

  ### Goal's coming into the competition
  * Test speed of setting up a training pipeline <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
  * Learn how to track model tuning experiments <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
  * Learn how to do speech recognition <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
  * Distill neural networks <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
  * Transfer distilled net to a Raspberry Pi <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->

  Notes:
  Tried doing this in 2 weeks, bad idea. Lost sleep, etc.

  Explain which ones worked out and which ones didn't.

  ### Lessons learned
  * Pay attention to competition announcements
  * <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" --> Training pipelines are great
  *when they work* <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  * <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" --> Test your code
  **often** <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  * <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" --> Practice bring focus to learning material

  Notes:
  CI/CD great for testing code, Unit tests good place to start (after
  learning how to writ code).

  Found several good papers try to troubleshoot.
